<p>
    As a general policy, no personal information is automatically collected from visitors to the UWC Web Sites. However,
    certain non-personal information of visitors is recorded by the standard operation of UWC&rsquo;s servers. This
    information is primarily used to provide an enhanced online experience for the visitor. Information tracked includes
    the type of browser being used by the visitor, the type of operating system in use by the visitor and the domain
    name of the visitor&rsquo;s Internet service provider. By having this information, Web pages optimized for a
    particular visitor&rsquo;s computer are automatically available to that visitor. Other uses of this information
    include internal review of the number of visitors to the sites but only in an aggregate and non-personally
    identifiable form. E-mail addresses and other personally identifiable data about visitors to this site are known to
    UWC only when voluntarily submitted. Personally identifiable information that may be collected in connection with
    visitors voluntarily filling out registration forms, contest entry forms or subscriptions to newsletters is retained
    by UWC and not sold or otherwise transferred outside of the company. This information is used to better understand
    visitors&rsquo; use of the UWC Web Sites and to support transactions made on the UWC Web Sites. However, this data
    in an aggregate form may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising or other uses. We sometimes also
    use e-mail addresses and other personally identifiable information to contact visitors who communicate with us. For
    example, we direct e-mail to visitors who provide us with their e-mail addresses for specific purposes such as
    receiving our e-mail newsletters or being notified if they have won one of our contests. Each e-mail newsletter
    always contains instruction on how to discontinue receipt of the newsletter.</p>

    you and UWC with respect to the Site. If any provision of the Terms of Use is found to be unenforceable or invalid,
    that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms of Use will otherwise
    remain in full force and effect and enforceable. The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right
    provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.</p>
